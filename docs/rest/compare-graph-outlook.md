# Compare Microsoft Graph and Outlook REST API endpoints

The Outlook REST APIs are available in both [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/) and the Outlook API endpoint (`https://outlook.office.com/api`). The APIs generally provide the same functionality and use the same resource types.

## Which endpoint should I use?

Microsoft recommends using Microsoft Graph whenever possible. The Microsoft Graph APIs include more features than just Outlook-related APIs, including OneDrive and Active Directory. Choosing Microsoft Graph endpoints allows your app to get an access token that can provide access to both Outlook data and other resources, without having to make multiple token requests.

However, there are some features that are either only available on the Outlook endpoint, or are only in beta on Microsoft Graph. If your app needs these features, you should choose the Outlook endpoints.

### Features only available on the Outlook endpoint

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Outlook Tasks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/api/task-rest-operations) | The Outlook API provides acccess to user's tasks. This feature is currently only available in beta on the Microsoft Graph endpoint. |

## Translating between Graph and Outlook

The majority of the Outlook APIs are documented in the [Microsoft Graph API reference documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs). In order to use this information on the Outlook endpoint, you need to translate a few bits of information.

### API versions

The Microsoft Graph API offers two versions: `v1.0` and `beta`, while Outlook offers `v1.0`, `v2.0`, and `beta`. Microsoft Graph `v1.0` matches Outlook `v2.0`, and Microsoft Graph `beta` matches Outlook `beta`.

### OAuth scopes

While Microsoft Graph and Outlook endpoints both rely on Azure AD-issued tokens, the [scopes](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/authorization/permission_scopes) that each endpoint are slightly different. Apps that use Microsoft Graph request scopes like `Mail.Read` or `Calendars.Write.Shared`. Tokens generated by requesting these scopes will not be valid for the Outlook endpoint.

To translate the scopes, simply qualify them with `https://outlook.office.com/`. For example, the Microsoft Graph scope `Mail.Read` translates to `https://outlook.office.com/Mail.Read` for the Outlook endpoint.

### Resource property names

The resources are the same between Microsoft Graph and Outlook. However, the two endpoints handle casing of the property names differently. Microsoft Graph uses camelCase for property names, while Outlook uses PascalCase. Translating between the two simply requires converting the case.

For example, Microsoft Graph [message resource](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/message) defines properties such as `subject`, `from`, and `receivedDateTime`. On the Outlook endpoint, these properties are named `Subject`, `From`, and `ReceivedDateTime`.

### Example: retrieving a message

Let's take a look at a simple example. In this scenario, a web app requests a list of messages in the user's inbox.

#### Microsoft Graph

First, the app has the user sign in to authorize the application. Because the app uses the Microsoft Graph scope `Mail.Read`, the authorization URL looks like the following:

```http
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?scope=openid+Mail.Read&response_type=code&client_id=<SOME GUID>&redirect_uri=<REDIRECT URL>
```

Once the app has an access token, it sends the following request:

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/mailfolders/inbox/messages?$top=1&$select=subject,from,receivedDateTime,isRead
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The server returns the following response:

```json
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users('b63d5fb9-4f43-44c4-8f9d-fd0727842876')/mailFolders('inbox')/messages(subject,from,receivedDateTime,isRead)",
  "@odata.nextLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/mailfolders/inbox/messages?$top=1&$select=subject%2cfrom%2creceivedDateTime%2cisRead&$skip=1",
  "value": [
    {
      "@odata.etag": "W/\"CwAAABYAAACd9nJ/tVysQos2hTfspaWRAAD8ujHV\"",
      "id": "AAMkAGI2NGVhZTVlLTI1OGMtNDI4My1iZmE5LTA5OGJiZGEzMTc0YQBGAAAAAADUuTJK1K9aTpCdqXop_4NaBwCd9nJ-tVysQos2hTfspaWRAAAAAAEMAACd9nJ-tVysQos2hTfspaWRAAD8tDzlAAA=",
      "receivedDateTime": "2015-11-03T03:21:04Z",
      "subject": "Scrum",
      "isRead": false,
      "from": {
        "emailAddress": {
          "name": "user0TestUser",
          "address": "user0@a830edad9050849NDA1.onmicrosoft.com"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Outlook

First, the app has the user sign in to authorize the application. Because the app uses the Outlook scope `https://outlook.office.com/Mail.Read`, the authorization URL looks like the following:

```http
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?scope=openid+https%3A%2F%2Foutlook.office.com%2Fmail.read&response_type=code&client_id=<SOME GUID>&redirect_uri=<REDIRECT URL>
```

Once the app has an access token, it sends the following request:

```http
GET https://outlook.office.com/api/v2.0/me/mailfolders/inbox/messages?$top=1&$select=Subject,From,ReceivedDateTime,IsRead
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The server returns the following response:

```json
{
  "@odata.context": "https://outlook.office.com/api/v2.0/$metadata#Me/MailFolders('inbox')/Messages(Subject,From,ReceivedDateTime,IsRead)",
  "@odata.nextLink": "https://outlook.office.com/api/v2.0/$metadata#Me/MailFolders('inbox')/Messages(Subject,From,ReceivedDateTime,IsRead)",
  "value": [
    {
      "@odata.etag": "W/\"CwAAABYAAACd9nJ/tVysQos2hTfspaWRAAD8ujHV\"",
      "Id": "AAMkAGI2NGVhZTVlLTI1OGMtNDI4My1iZmE5LTA5OGJiZGEzMTc0YQBGAAAAAADUuTJK1K9aTpCdqXop_4NaBwCd9nJ-tVysQos2hTfspaWRAAAAAAEMAACd9nJ-tVysQos2hTfspaWRAAD8tDzlAAA=",
      "ReceivedDateTime": "2015-11-03T03:21:04Z",
      "Subject": "Scrum",
      "IsRead": false,
      "From": {
        "EmailAddress": {
          "Name": "user0TestUser",
          "Address": "user0@a830edad9050849NDA1.onmicrosoft.com"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
